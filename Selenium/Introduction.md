**AI-Powered Test Automation**
--Selenium: the manually written script
AI-Powered Test Automation: it leverages AI techniques in testing. The techniques include NLP(Natural Language Processing), computer vision and machine learning
**Evolution of Test Automation**
Manual testing- human driven - time consuming and repetitive
Scripted Automation- selenium/TestNG- Brittle, high maintenance
AI-Powered Automation- self-learning, adaptive - smarter, faster, scalable

**AI-Powered Test Automation**: it uses AI techniques such as NLP, computer vision and ML to make software testing smarter, self healing and autonomous


**Key Capabilits of AI in Testing**
**Test Script Generation:** AI generates code from plain english
**Smart Element Locators:** AI identifies elements dynamically using ML models
**Self-Healing Tests:** when locators break, AI auto-fixes them
**Visual Validation:**AI detects visual/UI changes using image comparison
**Predictive Analysis:** AI predicts failure-prone arears in your test suite
**Natural Language Interface:** run tests via chat or voice commands
**Intelligent Reporting:**AI summarizes tst outcomes into plain english
