**Master Selenium WebDriver Automation Testing with Java & TestNG**

AI-Powered, GPT-Driven Selenium Test Automation

**Overview**
**Selenium + AI: UI Automation**
--This is aimed to UI Automation testing and selenium end-to-end testing automation with AI upport in test automation.
--We will implement core concepts of AI with thehelp of NLP and LLM.
--We will see how we can create the code base with AI help, how to summarise a report, how we can fix automations and we can generate end to end scripts with AI Help
